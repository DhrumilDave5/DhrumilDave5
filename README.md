- 👋 Hi, I’m @DhrumilDave5
- 👀 I’m interested in basically everything about the amazing invention called computers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python as a part of my school curriculum, but it seems so easy and so I would love to learn advanced concepts, and use GitHub to explore more software.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: email - dhrumildave135@gmail.com
